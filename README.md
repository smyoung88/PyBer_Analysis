# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we role-played as a second week data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. Our task was to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create compelling visualizations for the CEO at PyBer. CEO, V. Isualize, is interested to see the summary of the ride-sharing data by city type; specifically, the total weekly fares for each city type and the differences between them so decision-makers at PyBer can better their business. Those differences are summarized below.

## Results
The differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types is summarized below:
